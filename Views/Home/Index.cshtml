            Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High
            Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and
            architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for
            his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy,
            botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who
            epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later
            generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.
        </p>

        <h2>Early life (1452–1472)</h2>
        <h3>Birth and background</h3>
        <p>
            Leonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci ("Leonardo, son of ser Piero from Vinci"),
            was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence. He was
            born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero da Vinci d'Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426–1504), a
            Florentine legal notary, and Caterina di Meo Lippi (c. 1434–1494), from the lower class. It remains
            uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the
            historian Emanuele Repetti, is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered
            sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in
            Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had. Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his
            birth. Caterina – who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only "Caterina" or "Catelina" – is usually
            identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca,
            nicknamed L'Accattabriga, 'the quarrelsome one'. Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori – having been betrothed
            to her the previous year – and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages. From all
            the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy) who were much younger
            than he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old) and with whom he had very little contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Very little is known about Leonardo's childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of his
            biography in the frequently apocryphal Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects
            (1550) by 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari. Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 he lived in
            the household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci, but it is possible that he spent the years
            before then in the care of his mother in Vinci, either Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San
            Pantaleone. He is thought to have been close to his uncle, Francesco da Vinci, but his father was probably
            in Florence most of the time. Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an
            official residence in Florence by at least 1469 and had a successful career. Despite his family history,
            Leonardo only received a basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading, and mathematics;
            possibly because his artistic talents were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention
            there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus. While writing on the
            flight of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth with its tail;
            commentators still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.
        </p>

        <h3>Verrocchio's workshop</h3>
        <p>
            In the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian
            Humanist thought and culture. Around the age of 14, he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of
            Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time. This was about the
            time of the death of Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello. Leonardo became an apprentice by the
            age of 17 and remained in training for seven years. Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or
            associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi. Leonardo was exposed to
            both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy,
            metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of
            drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leonardo was a contemporary of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino, who were all slightly older than he
            was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio or at the Platonic Academy of the Medici. Florence
            was ornamented by the works of artists such as Donatello's contemporaries Masaccio, whose figurative
            frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold
            leaf, displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds.
            Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, and was the first painter to make a
            scientific study of light. These studies and Leon Battista Alberti's treatise De pictura were to have a
            profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of the painting in Verrocchio's workshop was done by his assistants. According to Vasari, Leonardo
            collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ (c. 1472–1475), painting the young angel holding
            Jesus's robe with skill so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio purportedly put down his brush and
            never painted again (the latter claim probably being apocryphal). The new technique of oil paint was applied
            to areas of the mostly tempera work, including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain
            stream, and much of Jesus's figure, indicating Leonardo's hand. Additionally, Leonardo may have been a model
            for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the archangel Raphael in Tobias
            and the Angel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vasari tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: a local peasant made himself a round buckler shield
            and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo, inspired by the story of Medusa, responded
            with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that his father bought a different shield
            to give to the peasant and sold Leonardo's to a Florentine art dealer for 100 ducats, who in turn sold it to
            the Duke of Milan.
